## Setup
This repo contains the compiled jar in `Atan`, and has a sample team. My mein own purpose, `makefile` and `gulp` are included too.


#### Gulp
Assuming you have global `gulp` (via `npm i -g gulp`), just do 

```
gulp
```

and it will auto `make` every time you save the source code. Saves the 5s you take to manually recompile and rerun after every safe - neat for development.

## run
